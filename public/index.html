            When i was 13, i came out to my parents as a morbius male. They couldnt accept my morbality, so they sent me off to camp. They just didnt understand— i was morbed that way. At the camp, they gave us electromorb therapy to morb us into beta males.
            I resisted the treatment, being a morbius male, you cant morb me out of being morbed.
            I fooled the counselors into thinking they had successfully morbed be into a beta male, and i returned home. To this day, i live a double life— one for my parents, who still cannot accept morbality, and one where its always morbin time.

            I’ve never felt so hurt.

            I’ve tolerated his gaming habits for the entirety of the relationship because I don’t want to be the controlling wife and I want him to be happy. It’s only the past 3 years that he’s come to bed extremely late. He talks about the game all the time and I let him indulge in his info umping.
            
            I’m set to go to the hospital on Monday as I might be close to delivering our first child. He said that his raid with his guild is on Tuesday and Thursday and he’s fighting the final boss of mythic and this might be his only chance to do it. The baby might be delivered next week.
            
            I don’t know how I feel about this or how to process this. I’m so afraid he will choose the game over us.

            The chunk-o'-text defense (COTD) is an alleged wikilawyering strategy whereby an editor accused of wrongdoing defends their actions with a 
            giant chunk of text that contains so many diffs, assertions, examples, and allegations as to be virtually unanswerable.
            
            However, an equal-but-opposite questionable strategy is dismissal of legitimate evidence and valid rationales with a claim of "text-walling" or 
            "TL;DR". Not every matter can be addressed with a one-liner, and validity does not correspond to length, especially the more complex the matter is
            . The COTD is characterized by noise and hand-waving, not simply verbosity.
